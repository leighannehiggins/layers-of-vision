altText2: This image shows a visual piece. It is vibrant blue in colour and shows feet moving in almost blurred motions over steps, on what could be described as a busy cityscape, the feet in this image are not all blue but are contrasted with some red, white and emboldened textures of blue throughout to show almost the shadowing of feet moving.

workTitle: Footfall in the City
year: 2022
workType: Two landscape format photographic lightboxes with layers of ink
workSize: 45 x 32 x 4 cm
workDescription: The lightboxes reflect Sally’s experience of negotiating the fast-moving, energetic city. She took photographs and made drawings around Bush House, and the walk from there to Waterloo station. The pieces are a composite of layers of legs, feet and limbs, as they passed her by on pavements and stairs, often visually confusing – ghostly traces of moving figures. Sally overlayed these with line drawings in thick coloured inks. The photographic background has been made blue to heighten luminosity.
