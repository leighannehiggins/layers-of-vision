Layers of Vision is an art exhibition that explores the experiences and perspectives of blind and partially sighted (BPS) artists living in a world made for sighted people. In meaningfully co-created and joyful ways, Layers of Vision raises attention to, and challenges, the barriers that people who are blind or have sight loss are facing in everyday life. It does so by
exhibiting ten artworks that celebrate and creatively explore accessibility.

Each artwork, in its own way, appreciates different forms of vision and features multisensory elements to foster engagement, stimulate discussions, and question common views and practices around access and disability inclusion in the arts and beyond.

_Layers of Vision_ is an exhibition devised by Dr Katharina C. Husemann (King's Business School), Dr Anica Zeyen (Royal Holloway, University of London) and Dr Leighanne Higgins (Lancaster University Management School). It is based on their ongoing research in which they explore how museums in the UK make their art collections accessible to blind and partially sighted visitors. Layers of Vision is presented by King's Business School with funding from its Innovation Fund. The exhibition is supported and produced by King's Culture and the project website by King's Digital Lab.
